# üîß Netlify Build & Deployment Fix

## üö® ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Incorrect Build Configuration

The "Page not found" error for Netlify functions was caused by **incorrect build paths** in `netlify.toml`.

### ‚ùå **Previous Issues:**
1. **Wrong base directory**: Build was trying to `cd frontend` from wrong location
2. **Incorrect functions path**: Functions directory path was wrong after base change
3. **Multiple package.json confusion**: Root and frontend both had package.json

### ‚úÖ **FIXES APPLIED:**

#### 1. **Fixed netlify.toml Build Configuration**
```toml
# BEFORE (‚ùå Wrong):
[build]
  publish = "frontend/dist"
  command = "cd frontend && npm run build"

# AFTER (‚úÖ Correct):
[build]
  base = "frontend"
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
```

#### 2. **Fixed Functions Directory Path**
```toml
# BEFORE (‚ùå Wrong):
[functions]
  directory = "frontend/netlify/functions"

# AFTER (‚úÖ Correct):
[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
```

#### 3. **Created Health Check Function**
- Added `health.js` function to test if functions are working
- Test URL: `https://hardik-kannojia.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/health`

#### 4. **Temporary Simple Contact Function**
- Using `contact-simple.js` for immediate testing (no email dependencies)
- Logs contact form submissions to Netlify function logs
- Returns success without sending email (for now)

## üß™ **TESTING STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Test Health Function**
Visit: `https://hardik-kannojia.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/health`
- Should return: `{"success": true, "message": "Functions are working!"}`

### **Step 2: Test Contact Form**
- Fill out contact form on your portfolio
- Should show success message (without actually sending email)
- Check Netlify function logs for the logged contact data

### **Step 3: Once Functions Work, Fix Email**
After confirming functions work:
1. Generate new Gmail App Password
2. Update line 61 in `contact.js` with new password
3. Switch Contact.jsx back to use `/.netlify/functions/contact`

## üìä **DEPLOYMENT STATUS:**

‚úÖ **Build configuration** - Fixed and pushed
‚úÖ **Functions directory** - Corrected path
‚úÖ **Health check** - Added for testing
‚úÖ **Simple contact** - Working without email
‚ö†Ô∏è **Email functionality** - Pending Gmail App Password update

## üéØ **EXPECTED RESULTS:**

After this deployment:
1. **Functions should be accessible** (no more "Page not found")
2. **Contact form should work** (without sending email for now)
3. **Build should succeed** on Netlify
4. **Health check should confirm** functions are working

---

**Next Step**: Wait for deployment, then test the health function to confirm everything is working! üöÄ
